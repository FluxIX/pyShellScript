- Add the 'unexecute' methods. This makes the shell undoable.
- Add a translation table to convert the python shell commands into operating system commands.
- Add an environment object for storing the environment data. Could be as simple as a dict.
	- execute( environment )
	- unexecute( environment = None )
	- clone()
	- Needs current CommandExecuter variable
	- Needs read-only current directory variable (the ChangeDirectoryCommand alters the VM current directory, so variable can simply call os.get_cwd())
- Add environment stack to the CommandExecuter
- Add an execution_status property
	- Options: Initialized, Executed, Unexecuted
- Add a history to the CommandExecuter. Internal commands would have to be written to interact with it (possibly only view it).
- Add the options as enumerations to the commands.
